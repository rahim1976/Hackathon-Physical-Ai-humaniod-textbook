- **Intelligent Search**: RAG system that grounds responses in your documentation
- **No Hallucinations**: Responses are strictly based on documented content
- **Easy Deployment**: Ready for GitHub Pages deployment
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for easy customization

## Who should use this?

This project is ideal for:
- Technical writers looking to enhance documentation with AI
- Developers wanting to provide better support for their projects
- Organizations seeking to automate customer support with accurate information
- Anyone interested in RAG systems and AI integration
