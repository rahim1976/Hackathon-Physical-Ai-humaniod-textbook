# Quickstart: ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics

## Overview

This quickstart guide provides a fast path to understanding the core concepts of ROS 2 in the context of humanoid robotics. It's designed for AI students and developers who want to quickly get up to speed with ROS 2 fundamentals.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of general robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces

## Getting Started

### 1. Introduction to ROS 2 for Physical AI

Begin with the foundational concepts that make ROS 2 essential for humanoid robotics:

- **What is ROS 2?** - Understand the Robot Operating System as a middleware framework
- **DDS Concepts** - Learn about Data Distribution Service for distributed communication
- **Why ROS 2 for Humanoids?** - Explore the specific advantages for humanoid robot development
- **Architecture Overview** - Nodes, topics, services, and actions

### 2. ROS 2 Communication Model

Dive into the practical aspects of ROS 2 communication:

- **Nodes** - The basic execution units in ROS 2
- **Topics** - Unidirectional communication channels
- **Services** - Request/response communication patterns
- **rclpy** - Python client library for ROS 2
- **Basic Agent Controller Flow** - How to structure simple robot controllers

### 3. Robot Structure with URDF

Learn how to define and model humanoid robots:

- **URDF Basics** - Understanding Unified Robot Description Format
- **Link and Joint Definitions** - How to define robot structure
- **Visual and Collision Properties** - Making robots look and behave correctly
- **Simulation Readiness** - Preparing models for simulation environments

## Next Steps

After completing these three chapters, you should be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 and its importance for humanoid robotics
2. Create basic ROS 2 nodes that communicate using topics and services
3. Define a humanoid robot structure using URDF
4. Prepare robot models for simulation
